# Pantry Management Application

This project is a pantry management application built with React and Firebase Firestore. It allows users to add, edit, and remove pantry items, as well as search for items within the pantry.

## Features

- Add new items to the pantry
- Edit item names and quantities
- Remove items from the pantry
- Search for items in the pantry
- Increment and decrement item quantities

## How It Works

The application uses Firebase Firestore as its database to store pantry items. Each item is stored as a document in the "pantry" collection. The frontend is built with Nextjs and Material-UI for the user interface.

### Core Functionality

1. **Adding Items:**

   - Users can add new items to the pantry by entering the item name and quantity. The item name is stored in lowercase to ensure consistency.

2. **Editing Items:**

   - Users can edit existing items by changing the name and quantity.

3. **Removing Items:**

   - Users can remove items from the pantry. If the quantity is greater than 1, it will decrement the quantity. If the quantity is 1, the item will be deleted.

4. **Searching Items:**
   - Users can search for items by name using a search field. The search is case-insensitive.
